# SortingAlgorithmVisualization

Sorting Algorithm Visualization tool written in JavaScript

## Description

This project is meant to showcase visualizations for some of the most common sorting algorithms, demonstrating my ability to implement them in JavaScript. The visualizations help in understanding how different sorting algorithms work by providing a graphical representation of the sorting process.

## Features

- Visualize popular sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, etc.
- Step-by-step animation of the sorting process
  
## Sorting Algorithms Implemented

- Bubble Sort
- Cocktail Sort(to be implemented)
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort(to be implemented)
